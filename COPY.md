### About the Ranch
Jiggs Ranch is a place we return to — for quiet mornings, long talks, and the kind of sky you can’t rush. It’s hunting land and family land, shaped by weather, time, and the people who keep showing up.

### What We Love Here (Cards)
Use 3–6 of these. Each card can have an image + a short caption.

1. **Sunrise Coffee** — The day starts slow, with a cup in hand and the light changing across the pasture, while deer graze.
2. **Mesquite & Wind** — The sound of the trees and the feel of the air before the heat settles in.
3. **Fence Lines** — Miles of stories and the familiar view that always feels like home.
### 4. **Family Dinners** — A table that stretches, with room for one more chair.
### 5. **Quiet Mornings** — Boots on a porch, a dog nearby, and nothing urgent.
6. **Open Sky** — Big horizons and the reminder that life is wider than our calendars.

### Plan a Visit
Jiggs Ranch is a working place and a lived-in one. If you’re coming out, just let us know ahead of time — and plan for a slower pace, a little dust, and a lot of sky.
